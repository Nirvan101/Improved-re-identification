# Improved-re-identification

I am making modifications to the re-identification model described in the paper [An Improved Deep Learning Architecture for Person Re-Identification](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Ahmed_An_Improved_Deep_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf).

`run.py` is the original file without attention.

In `run2.py` I have implemented visual attention. In `run3.py` I am currently in the process of implementing channel attention inspired by the paper [ABD-Net: Attentive but Diverse Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01114v3.pdf) 

Here is my design for the visual attention part.
